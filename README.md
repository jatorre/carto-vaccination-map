# cdc-vaccination-history

A [git scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) recording the CDC's [Covid Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) numbers on number of vaccinations per county.

We use this data to populate a table on BigQuery and then we generate a few maps from it.

More info on this when we publish the blog post.
